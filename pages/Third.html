            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p class="desc-heading">Overview</p>
            <p class="more-desc">- Merlot is a dark blue–colored wine grape variety that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. <br>-The name Merlot is thought to be a diminutive of merle, the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape.  </p>
            <p class="desc-heading">Alcohol Conatins</p>
            <p class="more-desc">- Merlot wines typically contain 13.5–14.5% alcohol by volume (ABV), which is relatively high compared to other wines.<br>- However, the exact alcohol content can vary depending on the region and specific wine.<br>- For example, Merlots grown in cooler climates, like France, usually have an ABV of 13–14%, while those grown in warmer climates, like Australia, California, and Chile, can have an ABV of 14.5%

            <p class="desc-heading">Wine Taste</p>

            <p class="more-desc">- Merlot is a medium- to full-bodied wine with notes of red fruit, like cherry, plum, and raspberry.<br>- It also has notes of oak, graphite, black cherries, and cocoa. <br>-When aged in oak, it can also have hints of cedar, vanilla, and clove
            </p>

            <p class="desc-heading">Benefits</p>
            <p class="more-desc">-  Merlot wines are often described as being "smooth" and "velvety." Merlot is also a rich source of resveratrol, which can help your cardiovascular health. <br>-Studies have found that Merlot contains high levels of procyanidin, a compound that helps to prevent cholesterol from buildup in the arteries</p>
            <p class="desc-heading">Capacity Of Bottle </p>
            <p class="more-desc">- A 750ml bottle of red, white or rosé wine (ABV 13.5%) contains 10 units.</p>
